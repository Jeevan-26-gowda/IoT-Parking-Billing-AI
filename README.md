Project Overview

The IoT-Driven Smart Parking and Automated Billing System leverages IoT sensors, microcontrollers, and AI to provide a seamless parking experience. Users can find available parking spaces in real-time, and automated billing ensures hassle-free payments. An AI conversational assistant allows intuitive interactions, providing information about parking availability, billing, and more.

Features

Real-time parking slot detection using IoT sensors

Automated billing based on parking duration

AI-powered conversational assistant for user queries

Web/mobile interface for monitoring and management

Notifications for slot availability
